      Name and version of software used to create the format. If it is
      private software, put some type of description here.

  DELIM:
    summary: |
      The delimiter used to separate fields in the report. Any ASCII character
      or UNICODE number that corresponds to ascii code 32-126 is acceptable as
      long as it is not used in any field.
      Suggested delimiters are: comma (,) semi-colon(;), and exclamation point(!).
      The only characters that cannot be used are the pipe(|), the pound/hash (#)
      or the " " (space). If you want to use a tab, use the word "tab" instead of
      an actual tab character.
      Note: Excel users who want to use a comma will have to type "comma" here
      instead of a ",". Otherwise Excel will export the field incorrectly.
  DATE:
    summary: |
      The format of the date used in the report. Times are midpoint of the
      observation. Convert all times from UT to one of the following formats:
          JD: Julian Day (Ex: 2454101.7563)
          HJD: Heliocentric Julian Day
          EXCEL: the format created by Excel's NOW() function (Ex: 12/31/2007 12:59:59 a.m )
    options:
      - JD

      submitting photographic/photovisual observations, please use the
      Visual File Format instead of the Extended File Format.

        summary: |
          Green Filter (or Tri-color green). This is commonly the "green-channel"
          in a DSLR or color CCD camera, or Astroimaging G filter. These observations
          use V-band comp star magnitudes.
      TB:
        summary: |
          Blue Filter (or Tri-color blue). This is commonly the "blue-channel"
          in a DSLR or color CCD camera, or Astroimaging B filter. These
          observations use B-band comp star magnitudes.
      TR:
        summary: |
          Red Filter (or Tri-color red). This is commonly the "red-channel"
          in a DSLR or color CCD camera, or Astroimaging R filter. These
          observations use R-band comp star magnitudes.
      CV:
        summary: |
          Clear (unfiltered) using V-band comp star magnitudes (this
          is more common than CR). A clear with blue-blocking (CBB) filter
          commonly used for exoplanet observations should be considered
          a CV filter. Report "CBB filter" in NOTES field.
      CR:
        summary: |
          Clear (unfiltered) using R-band comp star magnitudes.
          A clear with blue-blocking (CBB) filter commonly used for
          exoplanet observations should be considered a CR filter.

          Please Note: Due to a problem in WebObs, this filter choice is
          currently unavailable. Please consider removing your filter
          and using CV or TB/TG/TR instead.
  TRANS:
    summary: |
      YES if transformed using the Landolt Standards or those fields that
      contain secondary standards, or NO if not. Document the method used
      to transform in the "NOTES" section.
  MTYPE:
    summary: |
      Magnitude type. STD if standardized (Click here for definition of
      standardized) or DIF if differential (very rare). If you are currently
      using ABS for 'absolute' we will still accept it.
      Differential requires the use of CNAME.
    options:
      - STD
      - DIF
      - ABS
  CNAME:
    summary: |
      Comparison star name or label such as the AUID (much preferred)
      or the chart label for the comparison star used.
      Use "ENSEMBLE" for ensemble photometry.
      If not present, use "na".
    limit: 20
    type: str
  CMAG:
    summary: |
      Instrumental magnitude of the comparison star.
      If "ensemble" see example below. If not present,
      use "na".
    limit: 8
    type: float
  KNAME:
    summary: |
      Check star name or label such as the AUID (much preferred)
      or the chart label for the check star. If not present,
      use "na".
    limit: 20
    type: str
  KMAG:
    summary: |
      Instrumental magnitude of the check star, unless doing "ensemble" photometry
      in which case the calibrated magnitude should be reported.
      If "ensemble" see example below. If not present, use "na".
    limit: 8

  AIRMASS:
    summary: |
      Airmass of observation Limit 7 characters - entry will be truncated
      if longer than that. If not present, use "na".\
    limit: 7
    type: float
  GROUP:
    summary: |
      Grouping identifier (maximum 5 characters). It is used
      for grouping multiple observations together, usually an observation
      set that was taken through multiple filters. It makes it easier to
      retrieve all magnitudes from a given set in the database, say, if
      someone wanted to form color indices such as (B-V) with them. If you
      are just doing time series, or using the same filter
      for multiple stars, etc., just set GROUP to "na." For cases where you
      want to group observations, GROUP should be an integer, identical for
      all observations in a group, and unique for a given observer for a
      given star on a given Julian Date.
    limit: 5
    type: str
  CHART:
    summary: |
      Please use the sequence ID you will find written in Bold print
      near the top of the photometry table in a sentence that reads
      "Report this sequence as [ID] in the chart field of your observation report."
      If you used your own comparison stars (e.g. in the case of
      time-sensitive alerts when the Sequence Team had no time to create a sequence),
      do not give a chart ID, even if you plotted the chart using VSP.
      Use the comment code K (non-AAVSO chart) and give a proper
      chart name like "APASS DR10". Then add information on the comp
      stars in the notes.
    limit: 20
    type: str
  NOTES:
    summary: |
      Comments or notes about the observation. If no comments, use "na".
      This field has a maximum length of several thousand characters, so you
      can be as descriptive as necessary.  The convention to use for including
      a lot of information as concisely as possible is to use subfields after
      any freeform comment you wish to make.
      The subfield format is |A=B; the '|' character is the separator, A is a
      keyword name and B is its value. To make it possible to programatically
      access this information, use keywords taken from this list:
          VMAGINS, CMAGINS, KMAGINS are the instrumental magnitudes of target, single comp, and check star
          CREFMAG and KREFMAG are the reference magnitudes of comp and check
          CREFERR and KREFERR are the errors of the reference magnitudes
          VX, CX and KX are the airmass values for target, comp and check
      Transform coefficients can also be documented here. See the example below
      Not all the values are necessary. But using this mechanism you can
      document your submission in much better detail. Here is an example of a
      notes field created by TransformApplier:
          (free format notes)|NOBS=5|VMAGINS=-7.244|VERR=0.006|CREFMAG=13.793|CREFERR=0.026| KREFMAG=14.448|KREFERR=0.021|VX=1.1501|CX=1.1505|KX=1.1500|Tv_bv=0.0090|Tv_bvErr=0.0100| TAver=2.47
