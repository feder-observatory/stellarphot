+ If you already have aperture photometry for a field,
    * calculate relative flux (like [AstroImageJ](https://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/)), and/or
    * calculate calibrated magnitudes by transforming to a catalog (e.g. APASS DR9)
+ If you have calibrated images but haven't done photometry yet, you can do aperture photometry on your images.
+ If you have not calibrated your images, `stellarphot` can help -- choose the


## Installation

You can install `stellarphot` with either pip or conda. `conda` is recommended at the moment because of an issue with installing one of the dependencies of `stellarphot` in Python 3.9 or higher

Install with `conda`:

```
conda install -c conda-forge stellarphot reducer
pip install astronbs
```

or install with `pip`:

```
pip install stellarphot reducer astronbs
```

## Running stellarphot

1. Start jupyterlab from the command line: `jupyter lab`
2. Open the Launcher (see below)
3. Click on the notebook you want (see below)
4. Output files will show up in the file browser
5. Questions? Feel free to contact @mwcraig
